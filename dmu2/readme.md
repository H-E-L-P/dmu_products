This is a data product of the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project ([HELP](http://www.herschel.sussex.ac.uk)). This folder contains the Multi Order Coverage maps (MOCs), which define the regions on the sky for a given field.

HELP data covers 1270 square degrees of extragalactic sky divided into 23 disting fields. This dmu contains the definitions of each field. The file meta_main.yml

All the data is stored in the Git repository so you do not need to go to one of our external servers to download files.

## Folder structure
dmu2_field_coverages contains an individual file for each field. The top level file combines these into a combined map which defines HELP coverage.

File meta_main.yml can be used to loop over files for certain computational tasks.
