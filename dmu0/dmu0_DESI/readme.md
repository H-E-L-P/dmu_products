# DESI legacy imaging surveys

While we already include Legacy Survey and DECaLS photometry it is repeated here to provide the Tractor forced WISE fluxes and photometric redshifts presented in Zou et al (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab1847).

These awere downloaded from:

http://batc.bao.ac.cn/~zouhu/online-data/desi_photoz/

We are now using the DR8 version:

http://batc.bao.ac.cn/~zouhu/online-data/desi_photoz/LS_DR8_total_csp.fits

We originally downloaded the following files for dr6 and dr7:

and

The photometric redshifts will also be served on [VOX](https://herschel-vos.phys.sussex.ac.uk/)

History:
20191029: DR8 download.
20190708: First DR6/7 download.
