dr6_photoz_csp_totcat.fits: total photo-z and stellar mass catalog for DR6 including BASS+MzLS surveys
dr7_photoz_csp_totcat.fits: total photo-z and stellar mass catalog for DR7 including DECaLS survey
dr6dr7_photoz_totcat.fits: total photo-z and stellar mass catalog for dr6+dr7 after removing duplicate objects in DR6

NOTES
(a) There are magnitude offsets between DR6 and DR7. We apply magnitude corrections to DR6 photometry:  -0.0096, -0.0042, 0.051, -0.0099, and -0.0031 for g, r, z, W1, and W2.
(b) the catalogs only include galaxies classified by Tractor TYPE with r<23 and having colors within the color constraints as listed below. These color cuts indicate the applicative scope of our spectroscopic training data.
   * 0.09 < (g-r) < 2.20
   * 0.02 < (r-z) < 1.96
   * -1.16 < (r-W1) < 3.52 
   * -1.94 < (r-W2) < 3.16
