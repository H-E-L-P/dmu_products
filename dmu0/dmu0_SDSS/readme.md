Sloan Digital Sky Survey - 13<sup>th</sup> Data Release
=======================================================

This product contains the catalogues from the 13<sup>th</sup> data release of
the Sload Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR13).  Mattia queried the SDSS database and
sent us several files that we merged in a single table.

Because of overlaps between query coverages, we removed the duplicated rows
using the `objID` column:

```shell
$ stilts tmatch1 matcher=exact values="objID" action=keep1 in=merged_cat.fits out=cleaned_cat.fits
```

We also renamed the `field` column to `sdss_field` because the former name is
used in our workflow.

The resulting table was then processed with our `filterAndTag.sh` script and the
resulting catalogue was divided into one catalogue per field.
