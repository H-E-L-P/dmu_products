# ![HELP LOGO](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7880370?s=75&v=4) HELP pristine catalogues repository (DMU0)


This is a data product of the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project ([HELP](http://www.herschel.sussex.ac.uk)). 

DMU0 contains the pristine catalogues that may be difficult to get from their original location or that are private. The private catalogues will not be made available on our public survers. AS far as possible all data used and made by HELP is public.

Each folder contains a different input survey catalogue. The process for downloading and processing each is described in the respective folders.
