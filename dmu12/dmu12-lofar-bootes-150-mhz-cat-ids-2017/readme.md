# LOFAR Bootes cross-matched catalogue
## This product contains the LOFAR Bootes cross-matched catalog in various optical and infrared bands.

The catalogue has been created by picking out the best optical matches to LOFAR sources in the Bootes field. Only sources with a very high likelihood have been included in this catalogue.

The data can be found HEDAM at the following url http://hedam.lam.fr/HELP/data/dmu_products/dmu12/dmu12-lofar-bootes-150-mhz-cat-ids-2017/

The following text describes the various columns in the catalogue:

1. `Source_id` - Radio source ID
2. `Isl_id` - Island ID assigned by the source extraction software PyBDSM
3. `RA` - Radio RA (J2000)
4. `E_RA` - Error on radio RA
5. `DEC` - Radio declination (J2000)
6. `E_DEC` - Error on radio declination
7. `Total_flux` - Total flux in Jy
8. `E_Total_flux`
9. `Peak_flux` - Peak flux in Jy
10. `E_Peak_flux`
11. `Maj` - Major axis of the source in degrees
12. `E_Maj`
13. `Min` - Minor axis of the source in degrees
14. `E_Min`
15. `PA` - Position angle of the source
16. `E_PA`
17. `Isl_Total_flux` - Total flux inside the island fitted by PyBDSM in Jy
18. `E_Isl_Total_flux`
19. `Isl_rms` - RMS value within the fitted island in Jy
20. `Isl_mean` - Mean flux within the island (values have been defaulted to 0)
21. `S_code` - Source morphology; S: single component, M: multiple components
22. `P` - Probability of match being true; 1: better, 0: worse
23. `Prank` - Rank of optical match; 0: best match
24. `optical_ID`
25. `optical_RA`
26. `optical_DEC`
27. `GroupID` - ID for match group
28. `GroupSize` - Number of rows in match group
