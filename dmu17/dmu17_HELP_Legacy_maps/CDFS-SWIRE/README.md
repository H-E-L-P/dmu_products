### PSF stacking
Stacking was carried out using Seb Oliver's IDL PSF stacking code, using the script [mips_psf_cdfs-swire.csh](mips_psf_cdfs-swire.csh)


### PSF normalisation
PSF normalisation for CDFS-SWIRE MIPS map was carried out using Herve Aussel's Jupyter notebook 
[normalize_MIPS_psf.ipynb](./normalize_MIPS_psf.ipynb).

The final normalised PSF is:
`dmu17_MIPS_PSF_CDFS-SWIRE_20170818.fits`
