### PSF stacking
Stacking was carried out using Seb Oliver's IDL PSF stacking code, using the script [mips_psf_xmm-lss.csh](../mips_psf_xmm-lss.csh)


### PSF normalisation
PSF normalisation for XMM-LSS MIPS map was carried out using Herve Aussel's Jupyter notebook 
[normalize_MIPS_psf.ipynb](normalize_MIPS_psf.ipynb).

The final normalised PSF is:
`dmu17_MIPS_XMM-LSS_20180130.fits`
