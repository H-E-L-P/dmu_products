### Map homogenisation
Combining maps into homogenised HELP format was carried out using the Jupyter notebook [create_HELP_format_MIPS_map.ipynb](create_HELP_format_MIPS_map.ipynb)

The resulting map is:
`wp4_bootes_mips24_map_v1.0.fits.gz`

### PSF stacking
Stacking was carried out using Seb Oliver's PSF stacking code in folder [MIPS_PSF STACK](./MIPS_PSF STACK)

### PSF normalisation
PSF normalisation for Bootes MIPS map was carried out using Herve Aussel's Jupyter notebook 
[normalize_MIPS_psf.ipynb](./normalize_MIPS_psf.ipynb).
 
The final normalised PSF is:
`dmu17_MIPS_PSF_Bootes_20180129.fits`
