This folder is the top level folder for the Spitzer MIPS 24 micron
maps collected, homogenised and with value-added by the Herschel
Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP). 

These files are located within or near to the HELP boundaries. Where
map data was provided as separate FITS files (e.g. image, error,
coverage) these have been merged into multi-extension FITS
files. Point Spread Functions have been estimated for each image by
stacking on objects in the AllWISE catalogues.


* Maps from Spitzer Legacy survey teas
  * dmu17_Legacy_maps

* HELP homogenised versions of  the Spitzer Legacy survey team maps
  * dmu17_HELP_Legacy_maps

* Selection of Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP) Super Mosaics:
  * dmu17_SEIP_maps


* HELP homogenised versions of  Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP) Super Mosaics:
  * dmu17_HELP_SEIP_maps

## Caveat

These files were previously arranged in different folder structure,
with the original files and the HELP versions of the files in the same
folders. The code to generate the HELP versions and the PSFs were run
with those old folder structures and so will not work with the current folders.

## T.B.D.
* Some of the legacy survey team maps need to be collated and
homogenised.
* repair code to work with new folder structure

## Future work
This work can be extended to add Spitzer-MIPS 70 and Spitzer-MIPS 160 micron data.
However, those images are  superceeded by and Herschel-PACS which is
available in most HELP fields.
