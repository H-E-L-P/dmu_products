This is a data product of the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project ([HELP](http://www.herschel.sussex.ac.uk)).  This is collection of Super Mosaics (combining data from multiple programs where appropriate) of Spitzer MIPS data produced by the [NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/Enhanced/SEIP/).

The maps that are located here have been homogenised so that individual files for image, error and coverage have been merged into multi-extension FITS format files.

The original files from which these are dreived (as retrieved from ipac) are located below another folder ../dmu17_SEIP_maps
