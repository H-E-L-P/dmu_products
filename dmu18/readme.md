This folder is the top level folder for the PACS
maps collected, homogenised and with value-added by the Herschel
Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP). 

## Folder structure

The folders are organised by field. Each field folder contains the code required to make the point spread function based on stacking allwise positions.

There are also folders containing the HATLAS maps and the homegenised HELP PACS maps in [./dmu18_HELP-PACS-maps/](./dmu18_HELP-PACS-maps/)
