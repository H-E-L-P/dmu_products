# dmu26_XID+MIPS_XMM-13hr
Description:

  XID+ is developed using a probabilistic Bayesian framework which provides
  a natural framework in which to include prior information, and uses the
  Bayesian inference tool Stan to obtain the full posterior probability
  distribution on flux estimates (see Hurley et al. 2017 for more details).
 

## XMM-13hr

### Prior
  This catalogue uses sources in the masterlist that have a `flag_optnir_det` flag >= 5. For the full processing of the
   prior object list see the Jupyter notebook [XID+MIPS_prior.ipynb](./XID+MIPS_prior.ipynb) 
   

### Running on Apollo

To run on Apollo, first run the notebook [XID+MIPS_prior.ipynb](./XID+MIPS_prior.ipynb) to create the `Master_prior.pkl` and `Tiles.pkl` file. Then generate the
 hierarchical tiles, where $n_hier_tiles is the number of hierarchical tiles:
 
```bash
mkdir data
module load sge
qsub -t 1-$n_hier_tiles -q seb_node.q XID_plus_hier.sh
```
Then fit all tiles, where $n_tiles is the number of main tiles. Each tile requires 4 cores, 10G memory and estimated to run for 4 hours:
```bash
cd ..
qsub -t 1-$n_tiles -pe openmp 4 -l h_rt=4:00:00 -l m_mem_free=10G -q mps.q XID_plus_tile.sh
```
Then combine the Bayesian maps into one:
 ```bash
 python make_combined_map.py
 ```
 This will also pick up any failed tiles and list them in a `failed_tiles.pkl` 
file, which you can then go back and fit by editing the `XIDp_run_script_mips_tile.py` file so it reads in
 `failed_tiles.pkl` rather than `Tiles.pkl`.
  
 To make the final catalogue, I make a list of all the catalogue files and combine them with stilts:
 ```bash
 ls *cat.fits > cat_files
module load stilts
stilts tcat ifmt=fits in=@cat_files out=dmu26_XID+MIPS_XMM-13hr_cat.fits
```

### Final data products

  Final stage requires examination and validation of catalogues using [XID+MIPS_XMM-13hr_final_processing.ipynb](XID+MIPS_XMM-13hr_final_processing.ipynb).
  This notebook checks at what flux level the Gaussian approximation to uncertainties is valid and can be treated as a detection. 
  We also add notebooks based on this flux level and the `Pval_res statistic`.

  The resulting marginalised flux probability distributions for each source, are
  described by the 50th, 84th and 16th percentiles. For those wanting to assume
  Gaussian uncertainties, take the maximum of (84th-50th percentile) and
  (50th-16th percentile).


  We note the Gaussian approximation to uncertainties is only valid for sources
  above ~ 20 uJy at 24 µm:
