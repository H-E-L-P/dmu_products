# GSMF - Galaxy Stellar Mass Function

In this folder:

- [Notes](./Notes):
    .pdf files with notes about the process.
    

Main aim: providing material and references for the calculation of GSMF in HELP. This is an ongoing project to calculate the high mass end of the GSMF on Herschel-Stripe-82, using the HELP data products.
