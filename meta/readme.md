# ![HELP LOGO](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7880370?s=75&v=4) HELP meta data overview.


Because the large data files are not stored in GitHub, we decided it would be useful to create some record of data stored on HeDaM to ensure that we have a record of all the data stored there in the Git repository so that we can verify all the files.

We are also working on tools which use the meta_main.yml files and the meta_survey.yml files to retrieve meta data about the data files. meta_main.yml files describe the meta data associated with HELP generated data products and are based on the templates in [../TEMPLATES/meta_main.yml]. meta_survey.yml files describe externally downloaded files that were not generated by HELP and should contain any relevant acknowledgemt material that you will want to cite when using the products in publications.

The tools provided here should help you to take advantage of these meta data files in an automated fashion. However, they are easy to read text files so can be used for individual products.

The aim is that the HELP database will eventually be verified as [5 star open data](https://5stardata.info/en/) according to Tim Berners Lee's semantic web recommendations.
