# Bootes photometric redshifts

There were made with the Brown aperture matched catalogue which produced lower errors and failure rates than the positionally matched masterlist. We therefore present a notebook here for crossing in the help_ids using the masterlist. This is done via a join on first the Brown i band ids and then any remaining irac only objects.

This had previsoulsy led to a mismatch and incorrect photo-z associations here and in dmu32, dmu28.
