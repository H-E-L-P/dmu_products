*The title above should be meaninful for astronomers*

This is a data product of the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project ([HELP](http://www.herschel.sussex.ac.uk)). This sentence gives a very simple overview of what is stored in this folder understandable to a first year astronomy PhD.

The files in this folder provide templates for development of HELP documentation, acknowledgements and navigation. This second top level paragraph can give a bit more detail about what is stored here. Do you want any links to code used? Perhaps you should specify git versions or give a brief overview of what the code does.

The full files which are not stored in the Git repository can be downloaded from HeDaM:

## Folder structure
This section describes how this folder is organised. Is it organised by field or by some other criteria such as survey. Perhaps there should be a table here describing all the folders that are present? Perhaps there should be an overview of the format of the data files. Are they tables? Where is the description of the column headings in yml format? Where can the data be downloaded from? Do you have links to HeDaM files? Do you have example queries for getting info from a VO database? Do you need describe where inputs come from other parts of dmu_products. 

## Templates for Readme.md

[This file itself](https://github.com/H-E-L-P/dmu_products/tree/master/TEMPLATES/readme.md)
is a template for our readme.md files.

*comments in italics give guidance on what to put in template*


## Templates for meta-data files

The HELP standard for documentation of the provenance of data sets is
through the provision of ``YAML" meta files.  These meta files 

This directory contains template files to give the same information in text
files:

- `meta_main.yml` contains the main information on the HELP data product.
- `meta_survey.yml` contains the information on the original survey. When
  several surveys are combined, the work package must provide several files
  `meta_survey_1.yml`, `meta_survey_2.yml`, etc.

Those files are `YAML` containing several items (like FITS keywords) that can
easily be read by a computer programme. You should not worry and only fill the
information after the `:` preserving one blank line between items.
